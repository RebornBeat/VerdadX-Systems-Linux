- **Language**: Rust
- **Modules**: Built-in anomaly detection, system call tracing, and custom rule sets
- **ZSEI Integration**: Utilizes ZSEI's zero-shot embedding analysis to identify suspicious behavior patterns without prior training
- **Usage**:

```bash
sudo verdadx-detect start
```

#### Advanced Detection Features
